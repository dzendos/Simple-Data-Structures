# Simple-Data-Structures
This repository contains data structures implemented in the course of algorithms
## Folder Structure
These folders have the same structure - they consists of interface of a class they represent and their implementations. Only LinkedList contains one more class `Node.java` to represent nodes of a list.

- `hashset`: the folder contains interface and implementation of a HashSet.
- `linkedlist`: the folder contains interface and implementation of a LinkedList. Also contains additional file `Node.java` to represent nodes of a list.
- `linkedqueue`: the folder contains interface and implementation of a LinkedQueue.
- `queuedstack`: the folder contains interface and implementation of a QueuedStack.

## File Structure
In addition to aforementioned folders there are also several files:  
- `Checker.java` - contains some tests to check correctness of libraries `HashSet`, `LinkedQueue`, and `QueuedStack`.
- `Main.java` - launches `Checker` for all structures.
